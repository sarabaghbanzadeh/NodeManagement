# NodeManagement
Nodes, deployed in data centers, are connected across the country to transfer data. Nodes also report about their status.

The class nodeManager manages the entire system. The user can add/remove a new Node to/from the network, as well as adding/removing several clients to/from each of existing Nodes. If each of defined metrics threshold reaches the maximum, the nodeManager acts accordingly in order to have the network under control.

Once you run the application it gives you the instruction on the Console. You just need to enter the number corresponds to the task you want to perform and press Enter. You will see the result of your action right away and the system gives you the ability of performing another action if you wish.

- unit test has been provided for some of the main functions.
